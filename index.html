						<p>Arch Anywhere is an Arch Linux ISO which allows you to install Arch Linux from anywhere, with or without a network connection. This is a dual ISO containing package repos for both architectures (x86_64 and i686). The local package repos enable you to install Arch Linux without a connection to the internet.
						<br><br>
						This is the only installer of its kind which will allow you to perform a full Arch Linux install from start to finish without being connected to the network. I have written an installer script which makes it even easier than ever to install Arch with its guided interactive install process. Simply write this ISO to a CD or USB, boot it up, and type 'arch-anywhere'. Install Arch in a hurry, whenever, wherever, without being held back by your network connection.
						<br><br>
						This ISO is aimed at beginner and advanced Arch users alike. If you're curious about Arch Linux and just want to try it out you can do an install into virtualbox with Arch Anywhere as it supports virtual box guest utils. Or if you're an advanced Arch user who simply needs to deploy lots of systems very quickly my installer will save you hours in typing commands and downloading packages. Arch Linux, quick, easy, and straight forward, the way its meant to be.
						<br><br>
						You can find the latest version of <a href="download.html">Arch Anywhere</a> on the <a href="download.html">Download</a> page
						<br><br>
						*Note this installer contains packages updated every 2 weeks, its still your responsibility to establish a working connection and update packages.</p>
